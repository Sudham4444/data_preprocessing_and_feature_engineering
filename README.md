# Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
This repository focuses on data cleaning and feature engineering techniques applied to the House Price Prediction dataset. By applying these methods, the goal is to improve the model's performance and gain better insights from the data.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to preprocess the house price data by:
- Handling missing values.
- Removing outliers.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Feature scaling.
- Creating new features (feature engineering) to improve the predictive model's accuracy.

## Key Steps Involved:
### 1. Data Cleaning:
   - Identifying and handling missing data.
   - Treating outliers and erroneous entries.
   - Ensuring data consistency.
### 2. Feature Engineering:
   - Creating meaningful features from the existing data.
   - Transforming categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding.
   - Scaling numerical features to improve model training.
### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualizing the relationships between different features.
   - Gaining insights into the distribution of house prices and other variables.

## Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python: Programming language used for data analysis.
- pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
- scikit-learn: For feature scaling and encoding.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is a house price prediction dataset that includes features like location, number of rooms, lot size, year built, and more.

## Repository Structure:
- `notebooks/:` Contains the Jupyter notebooks used for cleaning the data and applying feature engineering.
- `datasets/:` The dataset used for analysis and modeling.
- `plots/:` Visualizations generated during exploratory data analysis.

## Conclusion:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering are essential steps in building a reliable predictive model. This repository demonstrates how these techniques can help improve the accuracy and robustness of house price prediction models.
